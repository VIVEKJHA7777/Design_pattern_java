Question
You are tasked with building a "Pizza Ordering System." In this system, users should be able to customize their pizza orders by specifying various options. Each pizza has a fixed base price, but the final price depends on the customization choices made by the user.

The available customization options include:

Size: Small, Medium, Large
Crust: Thin, Thick, Stuffed
Cheese Type: Mozzarella, Cheddar, Parmesan, No Cheese
Toppings: Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Onions, Olives, Peppers, Bacon (customers can choose multiple toppings)
Extras: Extra Cheese, Garlic Crust, Extra Sauce
Write a program to implement this system using the Builder Design Pattern. The builder should allow users to create a pizza with any combination of the above options.

Requirements:
Implement a Pizza class that represents a pizza with the properties mentioned above.
Create a PizzaBuilder class that allows step-by-step customization of a Pizza object.
The PizzaBuilder should have methods to set each of the properties (e.g., setSize(), setCrust(), etc.).
Add a build() method in PizzaBuilder that returns the final Pizza object.
The Pizza class should be immutable after it's built, meaning users should not be able to change its properties 
once it is created.
Write a simple main function to demonstrate how a user could create a pizza using the builder.
Example:

A user wants to order a Large pizza with a Thick crust, Mozzarella cheese, toppings of Pepperoni and Mushrooms, and 
the Extra Cheese option. The program should allow them to build this specific pizza and display its details.
